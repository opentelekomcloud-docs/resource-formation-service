What Are the Differences Between Creating an Execution Plan, Applying an Execution Plan, Creating a Stack, and Deploying a Stack?
=================================================================================================================================

**Creating an execution plan:** Generate an execution plan. You can browse the entire plan in advance to evaluate the impact on ongoing resources. Creating an execution plan will not change the stack. The system changes the stack only when the execution plan is executed.

**Applying an Exection Plan**: Trigger stack deployment based on an execution plan in available state.

**Creating a stack:** Provide an initial template to create and deploy a stack.

**Deploying a stack:** Trigger a new deployment by either deploying a stack directly or applying an execution plan.
