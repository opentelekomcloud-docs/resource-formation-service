Creating an Execution Plan
==========================

#. Log in to the management console.

#. In the upper left corner of the page, click |image1|, and then click **Management & Deployment** > **Resource Formation Service**.

   The \ **Dashboard**\  page is displayed.

#. To create an execution plan for an existing stack, you can use either of the following ways:

   -  Go to the stack list page, locate the target stack, and click **Update** in the **Operation** column.
   -  Alternatively, go to the stack details page and click **Update Template/Parameter** in the upper right corner.

   The subsequent steps are same as those in :ref:`Updating the Stack Template or its Parameters <en-us_topic_0000001991770625>`, except that you need to click **Create Execution Plan** instead of **Directly Deploy Stack** in the \ **Confirm Configurations**\  step.

   Then, an execution plan is generated, but the stack is not directly deployed. If you create multiple execution plans, they will exist in the same stack, as shown in :ref:`Figure 4 <en-us_topic_0000002121580000____d0e1136>`.
