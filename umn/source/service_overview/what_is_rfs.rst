What Is RFS?
============

Resource Formation Service (RFS) fully supports Terraform (HCL and Provider), which is a de facto standard. It manages system and service resources (all physical or logical entities that can be located and described, such as databases, VPCs, pipelines, and IAM roles). RFS automatically deploys specified cloud service resources based on the template which uses the HCL (an open ecosystem) syntax.

RFS focuses on automatically building Open Telekom Cloud resources in batches. It helps you create, manage, and upgrade required resources in an efficient, secure, and consistent manner, improving resource management efficiency and reducing security risks caused by resource management changes.
