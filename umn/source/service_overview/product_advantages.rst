Product Advantages
==================

**Declarative:** You only need to intuitively describe the final state of required resources, freeing you from the complex request process and simplifying resource management.

**Idempotent:** The idempotent effect of invoking the resource description code for multiple times ensures that resources are not repeatedly applied for.

**Secure and reliable:** Visualized audit, security, and compliance control policies prevent security risks caused by resource changes.

**Rich ecosystem:** The southbound ecosystem supports mainstream Open Telekom Cloud services. For details, see `OpenTelekom Cloud Provider <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/opentelekomcloud/opentelekomcloud/latest/docs>`__. The northbound ecosystem is fully compatible with the HCL syntax, eliminating a learning curve.

**Easy to use:** With comprehensive documentation and samples, resource management can be completed in five steps.

**Full hosting and cloud-based services:** You do not need to install any software, prepare executors, or manage underlying files and data.

**Automatic rollback:** If deployment fails for resources, RFS automatically returns the status of all resources to that of the previous successful deployment.
