RFS Documentation

With Resource Formation Service, you can manage system and service resources (all physical or logical entities that can be located and described, such as databases, VPCs, pipelines, and IAM roles). You can automatically deploy specified cloud service resources based on the template which uses the HCL (an open ecosystem) syntax.
